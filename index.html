      <h1>Context</h1>
      <p>The purpose of this project was to make 2 personas and a storyboard for users of a given interface.  
        The interace I chose was the laundry machines in Vartan Gregorian Quad at Brown University.  
        This project has 4 main parts, each with smaller subparts.  
      </p>
      <h1>Part 1: Preparation</h1>
      <h2>Subpart 1</h2>
      <p>An accessible interface in public view that I chose is: Washing Machines in the basement of Vartan Gregorian Quad at Brown University.</p>
      <h2>Subpart 2</h2>
      <p>Please see order list of questions for users regarding their experiences with the washing machine interface below.</p>
      <h2>Subpart 3</h2>
      <p>Below is a sketch and brief description of the washer interface.</p>
      <div class="gallery-container">
        <img id="interface" src="./IMG_5962.JPG" alt="interface sketch">
 
      </div>
      <h3>Description/Caption:</h3>
      <p>The problem that the interface is trying to solve is to be able to wash any type of clothes and to design the type of washing to target the type of clothing.  How its key components function to achieve this goal and solve the aforementioned problem is by allowing for varying level of soiling of clothing (the top row 3 buttons are varying degrees of soiled-ness.  Your clothes are soiled to the extent described in the corresponding button.)  The second row has two options for cycle: normal cycle or one for clothing that is delicate or bulky.  The user selects one.  The final row has 3 options for the temperature of the water: hot, warm, and cold.  Finally the green button on the bottom right starts the washer with the given setting combination that was selected (so some combination of one option from each row).  The top row of digits becomes an integer once start is selected and counts down the minutes left in the washing process.</p>
      <h1>Part 2: Recording Observations</h1> 
      <h2>Subpart 1</h2>
      <h3>User A:</h3>
      <p>•	Did not look at image/symbol depiction of directions. <br>
        •	Opened washer door and put detergent pods in first. <br>
        •	Used two separate machines and put a half of their clothes in each.  <br>
        •	Immediately pressed start on both machines after closing door.<br>
        •	So, default settings were used - that is 30 minutes duration, light soil, normal cycle, and cold temperature.  <br>
        •	He told me he had to go/was busy/rushed and so he couldn’t answer all of my questions.
        </p>
      <h3>User B:</h3>
      <p>•	Did not look at image/symbol depiction of directions. <br>
        •	Opened washer door and put his clothes in.  <br>
        •	Added liquid detergent after measuring it into the detergent compartment and shut it.<br>
        •	Used default settings as well and pressed start without changing any settings.
        </p>
      <h3>User C:</h3>
      <p>•	Did not look at image/symbol depiction of directions. <br>
        •	Presses start first <br>
        •	Then opens door<br>
        •	Then loads clothes and shuts door<br>
        •	Presses start again which starts the machine with the light soil, normal cycle and cold temperature as the settings. <br>
        •	Does not put in any detergent during any part of the process.
        </p>
      <h3>General Patterns with interface shared amongst users:</h3>
      <p>•	Each user reacted while using the interface as though nothing had changed.  Just a serious/non-emotional facial expression as they went about using the interface and using the machine.  <br>
        •	None of the users looked at/read the image/symbol depiction/directions of how to use the machine/controls.<br>
        •	Except for user C, they all opened the door to the machine first before touching the controls.<br>
        •	1 of them stated they were in a hurry.<br>
        •	They all used the machine’s default settings and the only button on the control interface they clicked was start.<br>
        •	2 of the 3 users added detergents before pressing start, but in different ways (pods vs. liquid).  The other user did not add detergent.<br>
        </p>
      <h3>Differences amongst user observations:</h3>
      <p>•	User B and C did not state they were in a hurry.<br>
        •	User C did not use detergent.<br>
        •	User A used pod detergent.<br>
        •	User B used liquid detergent.
        </p>
      <h2>Subpart 2</h2>
      <h3>Numbered list of interview questions that I asked:</h3>
      <p>1.	Before you came to Brown this semester, did you have any expectations regarding laundry in general? <br>
        2.	Regarding price? <br>
        3.	Regarding how available/busy the machines would be? <br>
        4.	Regarding how many options there would be on the controls or how easy or hard it would be to use said controls/how it would look? <br>
        5.	What are your motivations for using these machines?   <br>
        6.	What were your motivations for using this particular machine in this particular room?   <br>
        7.	Why use the machines now? <br>
        8.	If you had to describe your entire experience with the laundry/dryer machine interface (controls, everything, etc.) in one word, which would you pick? <br>
        9.	If you had to describe your entire experience with the laundry/dryer machine interface (controls, everything, etc.) in one sentence, how would you describe it? <br>
        10.	Without a word limit, how would you describe your experience with the interface? <br>
        11.	How has your experience compared to your expectations?   <br>
        12.	Faster or slower to accomplish your goals compared to your expectations?  <br>
        13.	Easier or harder to use relative to your expectations?  <br>
        14.	Better or worse experience relative to your expectations?<br>
        15.	What challenges did you face, if any, while using the interface?<br>  
        16.	How did you deal with those challenges?  <br>
        17.	Would you use the interface again, even with those challenges?  <br>
        18.	If you didn’t face any challenges, why do you think that is?
        </p>
        <h3>Interview Responses per User:</h3>
        <h4>User A:</h4>
        <p>•	Expectations of what the options would be: Delicates/normal/heavy duty.  Expected most machines would be broken and washer price would be $1.25/load, not free.  Expected machines to be busy and that he would have to come down several times to check if they’re free. <br>
          •	Why he used these particular machines and why now: No other option.  Timing. Convenience.  He said he needs clean clothes for parties.<br>
          •	Entire experience in one word: convenient<br>
          •	Wants his clothes to be untouched because they get damaged or shrunk easily if it’s warm or heavy duty so having more options like cold or delicate prevents that. The more options, the better.<br>
          •	He did not face any challenges because he uses technology a lot so he’s good at figuring out technology.
          </p>
        <h4>User B:</h4>
        <p>•	Expected the older machines that had six physical buttons, 3 on top (temperature), 3 on bottom (speed).  Unaware that washer would be free of charge. Expected machines to be busy because there’s only 4 machines for two buildings. <br>
          •	Motivations to use these particular machines: lives here, has access to it, and wants to clean his clothes.  Using it on a Friday evening, he expected the machines to be less busy.  There are so few machines, it seems like they’re always busy. <br>
          •	Experience in a few words: clutter, messy.  The directions are really bad (the pictures with symbols).  #2 on the picture directions is especially unclear regarding where the detergent goes.  Symbols don’t tell him anything.  He put the detergent in the wrong compartment the first time he used the machine.  The buttons themselves are okay, but the 3 buttons first row, 2 buttons second row, and 3 buttons third row layout confuses/bothers him. Felt like a middle button is missing. (See Figure 1 Below) The pictures/symbol directions are the worst part.<br>
          •	Experience is worse/slower/harder to use compared to expectations.  He expected/preferred the old interface (6 buttons, no soil feature, old layout made more sense/clearer).  The new interface has bad directions. Harder to understand/more complicated with more options. <br>
          •	If given another option, he would not use these machines again.  But he has no choice.  
          </p>
        <h4>User C:</h4>
        <p>•	No general expectations regarding interface/# of control options.  Non-particular about clothes he wears so it was not a big deal for him what the options were. Expected washer cost was included in tuition.  Disappointed that they charge $5 to do laundry normally.  Pleasantly surprised there were more than 4 washers for VGQ A and B.<br>
          •	Motivations for using these particular washers: convenience and he needs to do his laundry and is out of socks.<br>
          •	Entire experience with washer: Ambivalent. Does its job. Before the new washers/interface was installed, there was lots of flooding and weird smells, but the new ones are working well.  The layout is intimidating at first.  Normally fast experience but it depends.  Nothing the start button doesn’t fix.  <br>
          •	Challenges: Confused during first time using it.  Wasn’t sure where Brown ID Card would go and how to pay.  Didn’t realize that we’re getting it for free. Confused by what the symbolic/diagram directions was trying to convey.  He thought he should put his card in the arm-like extension that contains the directions at first. (See figure 2 below)<br>
          •	Even with the challenges, he’d use interface again because it’s a necessity.

      <h1>Part 3: Personas</h1>
      <h2>Persona 1: Rushed Raymond Description:</h2>
      <p>Rushed Raymond is obviously in a rush, has to do laundry, doesn’t want to be doing laundry, at first didn’t know how to pay or put his detergent in but now does after experience with the interface and is glad that there’s so many options for temperature, cycle, and soil as his clothes get damaged and shrunk easily.  The interface problems Raymond faces are how to pay for the washing machine, where to put his detergent, and which combination of setting options is best for his clothes.  The reason why/how Rushed Raymond represents users of the washing machine interface is because the real life users I interviewed were often pressed for time, didn’t know where to put the detergent/how to pay for the washing machine and were initially perplexed by the wide assortment of options on the control panel.</p>

      </div>
      <h2>Persona 2: Overwhelmed Oscar Description:</h2>
      <p>Overwhelmed Oscar is obviously overwhelmed, cannot understand the pictorial/symbolic directions on the washing machine, misses the older and simpler version of the interface/controls with less options, doesn’t know where to put the detergent, and is happily surprised that the laundry is free of charge.  He is overwhelmed/confused by the surplus of buttons and options to choose from on the control panel and wishes it were simpler.  He feels constricted as this is the only option of laundry machine available to him and so he'll use the machine again despite these challenges.  The reason why/how Overwhelmed Oscar represents users of the washing machine interface is because all of the real-life users I interviewed and observed did not use and were confused by the pictorial/symbolic directions on the machine interface.  They also did not know where to put the detergent when using the machine for the very first time.  They were all happily surprised to learn that the laundry machine was free of charge.  Any of the other characteristics of Overwhelmed Oscar were shared amongst many of the users as well.</p>
